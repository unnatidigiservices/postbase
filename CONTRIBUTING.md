# Contributing to PostBase

Thanks for helping! Bug reports, docs fixes, translations and pull requests are all welcome.

PostBase is maintained by [Unnati Digi Services](https://unnatidigiservices.in). It started as the blog for [GeoRank](https://georank.co.in) client sites, so changes must keep working both inside a GeoRank site (`/blog/`) and standalone.

## Ground rules

- **Keep it drop-in.** No Composer or npm dependencies, no build step. It must run by uploading files to shared hosting with PHP 7.4+.
- **Security first.** Anything that renders user content must go through `pb_sanitize_html()`, every state-changing request must check the CSRF token, and every action must be permission-checked through `pb_can()`.
- **Match the style.** Plain procedural PHP with `pb_` prefixed functions, short comments explaining *why*, and escaping with `pb_e()` on output.
- **Schema changes** go in `pb_migrate()` as a new numbered step. Bump `PB_SCHEMA_VERSION` and never edit an old step.
