---

Drop the folder into `/blog/` on any PHP host, or onto a domain of its own, open `/admin/` and start writing. There's no Composer, no npm, no MySQL and no framework, just a few PHP files and one SQLite database. Pages are small, load fast and are built for phones first.

## Why PostBase exists

[Unnati Digi Services](https://unnatidigiservices.in) built PostBase for its **[GeoRank](https://georank.co.in)** clients: local businesses whose sites needed a blog that loads fast on mobile, looks like the rest of the site, and never lets an unreviewed post go live. On a GeoRank site it installs in one click, uses the site's own header, footer, menu and theme, and signs GeoRank users in automatically.

PostBase is also available as a **free add-on for [Unnati LiteCommerce](https://litecommerce.co.in) sites**, styled to match your brand.

Nothing in it depends on GeoRank, though. It runs just as well beside any PHP website or as a standalone blog, so it's open source for everyone. Project information, guides and support live at **[postbase.top](https://postbase.top)**, which runs on PostBase itself.

## Features

- ✍️ **Write anywhere, paste without pain.**
  - Paste from **Word, Google Docs, WordPress (Gutenberg), Notion, web pages or any Markdown editor**, and headings, lists, bold and italic, links, tables, images and videos come through clean.
  - Pasted images are saved to your blog, so they never break later.
  - Type Markdown as you go: `## `, `- `, `1. `, `> `, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `---`.
  - Images auto-resize and can wrap left or right with a size, caption and alt text.
  - YouTube and Vimeo embeds, plus an HTML view.
- 🛂 **Publishing control with three roles:**

  | | Contributor | Editor | Admin |
  |---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
  | Write & edit own drafts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
  | Submit for review | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
  | Edit anyone's posts | | ✅ | ✅ |
  | Approve, publish, schedule | | ✅ | ✅ |
  | Request changes (with notes) | | ✅ | ✅ |
  | Pages, pinned posts, categories | | ✅ | ✅ |
  | Users, settings, permanent delete | | | ✅ |

- 🧾 **Review queue and audit trail.** Pending posts are counted in the sidebar, and every submit, approve, change request and unpublish is logged with who, when and why.
- 📄 **Pages and a featured post.**
  - Pages (About, Contact, Support…) use the same editor with clean URLs, and stay out of the post list.
  - Pin a post to feature it at the top of the blog home.
- 🏠 **Static homepage.** Make any Page your homepage; the post list moves to `/posts/` automatically, with SEO-safe redirects.
- 🖼️ **Media Manager.** A thumbnail library of every image, with a popup preview, one-click copy link, "used in" tracking and multi-select delete.
- 🧰 **Custom header and footer code.** Add site-verification tags, analytics or chat widgets to every page from Settings → Code.
- ⏰ **Scheduled posts.** Publish with a future date and the post goes live on its own.
- 📱 **Fast and mobile-first.**
  - No JavaScript framework on public pages.
  - Lazy-loaded, resized images.
  - Responsive layouts that stack cleanly on phones.
- 🔎 **SEO built in.**
  - Tags: clean URLs, canonical tags, meta descriptions, Open Graph and Twitter cards.
  - Structured data: `BlogPosting` and `WebPage` JSON-LD.
  - Discovery: an XML sitemap, a summary RSS feed, reading time and search.
- 🧩 **Themes and plugins.**
  - Settings → Addons activates themes and plugins and gives each a settings form.
  - Build your own with a folder and an `addon.json`; see [docs/ADDONS.md](docs/ADDONS.md).
  - The first official addon is **PostBase M1** ("Mobile One"): one layout for every device, with a 720px column, a 640px reading width, and a thumb-friendly header of three 100px blocks (logo, action, menu). You pick the header, container, footer and outside colours.
- 🎨 **Your design.** It follows the site's theme automatically. Settings → Design adds fonts, colours, a favicon and a default share image, and Settings → Navigation edits the menu.
- 🔐 **Secure by default.**
  - Every post body passes a server-side HTML allowlist sanitizer.
  - CSRF tokens, `password_hash` and login throttling.
  - A non-executable uploads folder and a locked data folder.
- 📦 **Zero setup.** A single SQLite file. Back up the whole blog by copying `data/` and `uploads/`.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or newer (8.x recommended) with `pdo_sqlite`, which is enabled by default on almost every host
- Optional: `gd` (image resizing), `mbstring`, `intl`/`iconv` (nicer slugs)
- Apache with `mod_rewrite` for clean URLs. Without it, PostBase falls back to `?p=slug` URLs. See [Nginx](#nginx) below.

## Install

### Next to an existing site (`/blog/`)

1. Download or clone this repository into a folder named `blog` in your web root:
   ```
   public_html/
   ├── index.html        ← your site
   └── blog/             ← PostBase
   ```
2. Make sure `blog/data/` and `blog/uploads/` are writable by PHP (usually they already are).
3. Visit `https://your-site.com/blog/admin/` and create the first admin account. (Optional: set `setup_key` in `config.php` first.)
4. In **Settings**, click **Add blog sitemap to robots.txt**. Then add a "Blog" link to your site menu.

### As a whole site on its own domain

Put the files directly in `public_html/`. The blog becomes the home page, posts live at `/post-slug/`, the admin is at `/admin/`, and `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are served for you. Create About, Contact and similar pages under **Pages**, and add them in **Settings → Navigation**.

> On a public domain, set `setup_key` in `config.php` **before** uploading, so nobody else can claim the first-run setup screen.

### On a GeoRank site

Use **Control Center → Upgrade → Blog → Install Blog** in GeoRank (v1.90+). Every file is checksum-verified, updates never touch posts or images, and GeoRank users are signed in automatically. See [docs/GEORANK.md](docs/GEORANK.md).

### Updating

Replace every file except `config.php`, `data/` and `uploads/`. Database upgrades run automatically on the next page load.

## Nginx

```nginx
# PostBase in /blog/ (for a whole-domain install, drop the /blog prefix)
location /blog/ {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /blog/index.php?$args;
}
location ~ ^/blog/(data|lib|tools|docs)/ { deny all; }
location ~ ^/blog/uploads/.*\.(php|phtml|html?)$ { deny all; }
```

## Why SQLite?

We compared plain text files, JSON and SQLite for a multi-author workflow. See [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md).

## Roadmap

- Tags, revisions with one-click restore, email notifications for review requests
- Media library browser, image alt-text reminders
- Import from WordPress (WXR) and export to Markdown/JSON
- Comments (opt-in, moderated)
- MySQL driver for large installs
